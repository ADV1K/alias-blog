Lush green trees, monsoon weather, soul cooling winds coming from the tumoultous waters of the beach where sounds of waves splashing over the dry sand can be heard by people walking by. Now, imagine a tech conference on a piece of software that today powers almost half of the web at this place that I described. How can you be able to stop yourself? I couldn't.

React India was the first ever international, community-led beach conference that provided a platform for developers to share and discuss their insights and experiences with React. The three-day conference is the first of its kind in India broken into workshops and conference days with community talks from 26th September - 28th September 2019

Before leaving for the conference, I decided to do something for the first time. It was to capture a picture of everyone I met at the conference and tweet about it, that way when the conference ends. I can write this blog much more easily. Now, you know why its a tweet story. 

## The Journey 

The journey starts with me filling the diversity scholarship form for React India and in turn getting selected from a pool of hundreds. Happy to say, 9 other people who were selected were gems in their own fields as I had a marvellous time interacting with each and everyone.

Hopped on the early morning flight to Goa and was met with brief patch of Goa rains with stormy weather. As we travelled to the South side of Goa with the bus filled of React India attendees.

## Workshops Galore

The first day of the React India was all about workshops and connecting with individuals. I met professionals from Accenture, Verizon, Paperphile and made new connections while touring the amazing property of Planet Hollywood. It was a beach conference, why not enjoy it?. 

There were many workshops happening that day, most notably of Siddharth's about Building your first Design System: from scratch to production and Vladmir Novik's workshop about Practical ReasonML for React devs.

## Tell us more about the conference

The conference was extremely well organized. I have seen almost nothing like it, the entire main hall where the single track conference took place was made out of German hanger tent, completely waterproof, Air-conditioned and was located out in the open. There were community talks, quizzes, games, company stalls and even an after party where [Ken Wheeler](https://twitter.com/ken_wheeler) performed remotely! 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thinking of catching a break from all the amazing sessions at <a href="https://twitter.com/react_india?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@react_india</a> to get some peace and quiet. <br><br>Well, just wander around. <a href="https://t.co/rxJMfwJVpY">pic.twitter.com/rxJMfwJVpY</a></p>&mdash; Vipul Gupta üê£ (@vipulgupta2048) <a href="https://twitter.com/vipulgupta2048/status/1177120244940165120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 26, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## Day 1 begins

The conference started out with the very talented and extremely renowned speaker, giving the opening keynote, [Sunil Pai](https://twitter.com/threepointone). GraphQL was in the air as a lot of talks focused on refactoring, DRY approaches for it, even some great applications with it as Nader talked about in his talk. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Curious cases of <a href="https://twitter.com/GraphQL?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@graphql</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/dabit3?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@dabit3</a> as he guides us through future ways of web and mobile application development with serverless, GraphQL transform Library and AWS. <br><br>He works as a <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DevRel?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DevRel</a> for <a href="https://twitter.com/awscloud?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@awscloud</a> <a href="https://t.co/S1jSmzsoiD">pic.twitter.com/S1jSmzsoiD</a></p>&mdash; Vipul Gupta üê£ (@vipulgupta2048) <a href="https://twitter.com/vipulgupta2048/status/1177453791840354304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 27, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

GraphQL is much more than efficiently pulling data, and I am glad Nader's talk helped make the case for it as he showcased the powers of AWS Amplify as well as some awesome problems he solved with GraphQL. 

Moving on, I took a break from GraphQL and attended talks by [Ives van Hoorne]() about building [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io
), and React for teenagers by my roomate, Yash Gupta. Both very inspirational on how to build products for everyone and contributing back to the community. You all should really try CodeSandbox, it's like VsCode but online and more flexible.

## Community is where the heart is

Open-Source was a general theme behind the conference, where people talked from how we can build more inclusive communities to releasing new frameworks for blogging platforms to conflict resolution to this amazing quote by Carolyn in her talk about "Intitutive tooling". 

> "We mistake familiarity for simplicity"‚Ää-‚ÄäCarolyn Stransky

She argues on the fact that we developers, once we are fluent with a framework/technology, we end up introducing it as "simple". While its simple for you now it might not be to a newcomer due to a steep learning curve or due to improper documentation. ([Picked up from source](https://dev.to/kay_2695px/react-india-2019-1goa))

I loved [Jason Lengstorf](https://twitter.com/jlengstorf)'s talk as he asks the question **Is open-source really open?**. He highlights several issues, he saw with his time at Gatsby and simple principles that communiites and corporations can follow to eliminate those problems and be supportive towards all it contributors.

I had the most insightful discussions with folks from the community, including this one talk from [Tanvi Bhakta](https://twitter.com/tanvibhakta_) on buildiing healthier, more inclusive workplace culture. She also is working on an awesome project, that you all should check out and support. it's called [Desi Deck of Dames](https://desideckofdames.com/) and it's awesome!!

Making connections is all about why we attend conferences, and I finally met these two in the halls. One is the organiser of Hackerspace Mumbai, an incredible community working on the forefront of tech and the other an extremely talented, newly appointed DevRel for Dgraph Labs!
